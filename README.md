# Spring-Boot-Deploy


#### There are several ways to deploy a Spring Boot application, some of which include:


1.	Packaging the application as a self-contained executable JAR file and running it using the java -jar command.

2.	Using a web server such as Apache Tomcat, Jetty, or Wildfly to deploy the application.

3.	Using a cloud-based platform such as AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google Cloud Platform, or Heroku to deploy the application.
4.	Using Docker to containerize the application and deploy it to a container orchestration platform such as Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.
5.	Using a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) provider such as OpenShift, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, or AWS Elastic Beanstalk to deploy the application.
It's important to note that the most appropriate method for deploying a Spring Boot application will depend on your specific requirements, including the type of application, the infrastructure you have in place, and your desired level of control over the deployment process.


#### Here's an example of a Knative service YAML file that deploys a Spring Boot application to a Kubernetes cluster::


```

apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: spring-boot-app
spec:
  runLatest:
    configuration:
      revisionTemplate:
        spec:
          container:
            image: gcr.io/your-project/spring-boot-app:latest
            env:
              - name: JAVA_OPTS
                value: -Dspring.profiles.active=prod
            ports:
              - name: http
                containerPort: 8080


```


This YAML file deploys a Knative service called "spring-boot-app" using the latest image of the Spring Boot application located on the Google Container Registry (gcr.io). It also sets the active Spring profile to "prod" and maps the container port 8080 to the service's port named "http". You can edit this file to match your specific requirements.

#### You can use the following command to deploy the service into your cluster:

```
kubectl apply -f service.yaml

```

It's also important to make sure that the Knative serving component is installed in your cluster and that your cluster has access to the image registry where your Spring Boot image is stored.



#### Here is an example of a Dockerfile that can be used to build a container image for your Spring Boot application::


```

FROM openjdk:8-jdk-alpine

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the jar file to the container
COPY target/*.jar app.jar

# Expose the port that the application runs on
EXPOSE 8080

# Start the application
CMD ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]


```


This Dockerfile uses the openjdk:8-jdk-alpine image as the base image, sets the working directory to /app, copies the jar file produced by the build to the container, exposes port 8080, and runs the command java -jar app.jar to start the application.

You need to change the COPY command as per your jar file name and also update the command which runs your jar file.

Make sure you have a jar file of your spring boot application before building the image.
